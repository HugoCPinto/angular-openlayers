# OpenLayers with Angular

This project demonstrates how to use OpenLayers in an Angular application to display a map, add markers (circles) for specific coordinates, draw a line between two points, and calculate the distance between them.

## Features

- **Map Display**: Displays a map using OpenStreetMap as the base layer.
- **Markers**: Displays circles at specified geographic coordinates.
- **Line between two points**: Draws a line between two points and calculates the distance.
- **Distance Display**: The distance between two points is displayed on the map along the line connecting them.
